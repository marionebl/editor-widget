## Usage

react-blessed-editor is designed to work with react-blessed. At its core it only provides
stateless components â€“ logic is implemented in cherry-pickable reducers, actions and connectors.

**Using default reducers and connector**

```js
import React from 'react';
import {render} from 'react-blessed';
import {Screen} from 'blessed';

import {createStore, combineReducers} from 'redux';
import {Editor, createEditorReducers, createEditorConnectors} from 'react-blessed-editor';

const editorReducers = createEditorReducers('default'); // create reducers namespaced to `.default`
const editorReducer = combineReducers(editorReducers);

const editorStore = createStore(editorReducer, {
	default: {
		contents: 'This will be the initial content\n\nIt is namespaced to .default'
	}
});
const ConnectedEditor = createEditorConnectors('default')(Editor);
const Application = <Provider store={editorStore}><ConnectedEditor/></Provider>;

render(Application, screen);
```
